# Mini Project - Color Spinner

## Project Description

This mini project was made to practice prop drilling and the useState hook in react! Type a color in the input window to see the color and it's associated hexcode in the spinning square. Click the dark mode button if the text becomes illegible due to the text being the same shade as the color.
